  <h1>Semantics in HTML - Let's understand</h1>
  <p> Like many before me, I used to put tags in places where they had no business being. That's before I knew about the Semantic meaning that some tags held.</p>
  <img src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/codecademy/original/5X/3/9/4/5/394533cfe910e89b6436e572576f3f3c751bdfa0.png" alt="">
  <p>"A semantic element is an element of code that uses words to clearly represent what that element contains, in human language."</p>
  <p>As stated above, semantic elements do not represent a feature, only an indication about what the non-semantic tags inside them hope to achive. For example, the header tag(&lt;header&gt;) does not hold a heading in itself but holds an indication that there are elements inside it that make up the heading of given website.</p>
  <p>Unlike a 'div' tag, semantic elements actually serve the purpose of telling the browser and user, the content of the tags they house. While using a div tag makes no difference in the functioning of a website, the browser would have a hard time figuring out its content, resulting in poor ranking. It is also easier to maintain and read a document that follows proper semantics as opposed to one that dosen't.</p>
  <p>Here are a few semantic tags that I don't think require explaination.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong></li>
    <li> <strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong> </li>
    <li> <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'll try my best to explain in brief the purpose of following semantic tags.</p>
  <ul>
    <p> <strong>&lt;aside&gt;</strong>: This tag houses content that is besides the topic/content displayed in the site.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;mark&gt;</strong>: Holds text that is highlighted or marked to stress importance.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;nav&gt;</strong>: Houses links that are used to navigate between different pages within the website or different websites altogether.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;figure&gt;</strong>: Like the name suggests, they contain diagrams or figures or illustrations or photos etc.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;figcaption&gt;</strong>: They are placed either as the first or last child of a &lt;figure&gt; tag. They contain captions for declared figure element.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;time&gt;</strong>: When displaying any time or date information, this tag is invoked.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong>: Used when dividing the document into groups of generic sections. </p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong>: It is used to define content that has an independent body, featuring a specific topic. </p>
  </ul>

    <p>The below images might shed better light. The first image shows an HTML doc with 'div' tags used extensively, while the second image depicts an HTML doc sporting a clean and systematic code.</p>
    <img src="images/code1.png" alt="">
    <img src="images/code3.png" alt="">
    <p> The difference I'm sure, is apparent. While this all seems to make sense, what if one were to declare a semantic element and then put tags that have nothing to do with it, inside the element? Well, the site would still function, but the developer would be deemed 'irresponsible'. </p>
    <p> See, when a website is hosted on the internet, it is accessed by the population in its entirety. And using the right semantic ensures the content is delivered in a proper manner to people with disabilities like the rest of the population. So the developer bears a moral responsibility that transcends his paycheck, one which he must always adhere to. </p>
    <p>It is therefore a good practice to write semantically correct code from early on, something I didn't do.</p>
