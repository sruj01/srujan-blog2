  <h1>Semantics in HTML - Let's understand</h1>
  <p> Like many before me, I used tags in places where they had no business being. That's before I knew about the Semantic meaning that some tags held.</p>
  <img src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/codecademy/original/5X/3/9/4/5/394533cfe910e89b6436e572576f3f3c751bdfa0.png" alt="">
  <p>"A semantic element is an element of code that uses words to clearly represent what that element contains, in human language."</p>
  <p>As stated above, semantic elements do not represent a feature, only an indication about what the non-semantic tags inside them hope to achive. For example, the header tag(&lt;header&gt;) does not hold a heading in itself but holds an indication that there are elements inside it that make up the heading of given website.</p>
  <p>Unlike a div tag, semantic elements actually serve the purpose of telling the browser and user, the content of the tags they house. While using a div tag makes no difference in the functioning of a website, it makes it hard for browsers to detect their content, resulting in delay. It is also easier to maintain and read a document that follows proper semantics.</p>
  <img src="https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/images/3/39/Elements.png" alt="">
  <p>Here are a few semantic tags that I don't think require explaination.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong></li>
    <li> <strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong> </li>
    <li> <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'll try my best to explain in brief the purpose of following semantic tags.</p>
  <ul>
    <p> <strong>&lt;aside&gt;</strong>: This tag houses content that is besides the topic/content displayed in the site.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;mark&gt;</strong>: Holds text that is highlighted or marked to stress importance.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;nav&gt;</strong>: Houses links that are used to navigate between different pages within the website or different websites altogether.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;figure&gt;</strong>: Like the name suggests, they contain diagrams or figures or illustrations or photos etc.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;figcaption&gt;</strong>: They are placed either as the first or last child of a &lt;figure&gt; tag. They contain captions for declared figure element.</p>
    <p> <strong>&lt;time&gt;</strong>: When displaying any time or date information, this tag is invoked.</p>
  </ul>
